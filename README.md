# The Air Cafe: QR Code Ordering System

## Introduction

The Air Cafe project is a streamlined ordering system designed to improve efficiency and customer experience in cafes and restaurants.  Customers order meals directly from their table by scanning a unique QR code, eliminating the need for physical menus and waitstaff order-taking.  Cafe owners gain real-time visibility into orders, allowing for quicker service and improved order management. This system aims to reduce wait times, improve accuracy, and enhance the overall dining experience.


## Installation

This project requires a frontend (customer-facing) and a backend (cafe owner-facing) application.  The specific installation instructions will depend on the technologies used (e.g., React, Node.js, Python, etc.).  Detailed instructions will be provided in separate READMEs within the `frontend` and `backend` directories once the project is developed.  For now, here's a placeholder:
